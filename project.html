	 		<p>
	 			<b>1907</b> -  Satyendra began high school at the illustrious Hindu School. He was quickly recognized as an outstanding pupil, especially in mathematics and the sciences.
	 		</p>

	 	<li>
	 		<p>
	 			<b>1909</b> - He began a bachelor of science degree at Calcutta Presidency College.He majored in Applied Mathematics, and again he proved to be an outstanding student, graduating in 1913 at the top of his class, with first class honors.
	 		</p>
	 	</li>

	 	<li>
	 		<p>
	 			<b>1915</b> - He enrolled for a master's degree in Applied Mathematics at the University of Calcutta.He graduated at the top of his class. He also learned enough scientific German and French to read works published in these languages.
	 		</p>
	 	</li>
	 	<li>
	 		<p>
	 			<b>1916-17 </b> - Bose started giving applied mathematics lectures and mathematical physics lectures.

	 		<p>
	 			<b>1919</b> -  Bose and Saha published English translations of Albert Einstein's special and general relativity papers.
	 		</p>
	 	</li>
	 	<li>
	 		<p>
	 			<b>1924</b> - Bose sent his paper directly to Einstein "I have ventured to send you the accompanying article for your perusal and opinion. I am anxious to know what you think of it. You will see that I have tried to deduce the coefficient 8&#8719;v<sup>2</sup>/c<sup>3</sup> in Planck's Law independent of the classical electrodynamics".
	 		</p>
	 	</li>
	 	<li>
	 		<p>
	 			<b>1946</b> - Paul Dirac coined two new words to cover the two groups of particles that exist in the subatomic world: the boson, named in honor of S. N. Bose; and the fermion, named in honor of Enrico Fermi.

	 	</li>
	 	<li>
	 		<p>
	 			<b>1927</b> - <b>Bose never got a Ph.D degree. He could easily have been awarded one for his invention of quantum statistics</b> he did not need the title 'doctor'.  <br />After his paper was published, he spent two years in Europe working in France and Germany. He returned to Dhaka where he became head of physics.
	 		</p>
	 	</li>
	 	<li>
	 		<p>
	 			<b>1945</b> - Bose returned to the University of Calcutta and taught there until 1956. In 1959, at age 65, he was given the honorary title of India's National Professor.
